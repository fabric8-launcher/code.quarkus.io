# Code Quarkus App

 [![Tests](https://github.com/quarkusio/code.quarkus.io/actions/workflows/build.actions.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/quarkusio/code.quarkus.io/actions/workflows/build.actions.yml) [![Version](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/io.quarkus.code/code-quarkus?logo=apache-maven&style=flat-square)](https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.quarkus.code/code-quarkus)

The structure of this Web app is a bit special as it is possible to extend and customize it. It is what we could call a Fullstack React library thanks to the power of the [Quarkus Web Bundler](https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-web-bundler). It also contains our community implementation for code.quarkus.io.

üìÅ  **./base** is the base library, it contains the Api and the React library, it also contains the community-app React app which can be disabled in production

üìÅ  **./community-app** is the community-app Quarkus app, it uses the base library without doing much as it directly use the community-app inside it.

üìÅ  **./acceptance-test** are the test which run to auto promote new versions to production

https://github.com/redhat-developer/code.quarkus.redhat.com is an example of how this can be extended and customized.

# Development

Api is located in `base/src/main/java`
UI is located in `base/src/main/resources/web/`

Use this command to start `community-app` dev mode on: http://0.0.0.0:8080 (Api and UI).
```
cd base && quarkus dev
```

Build the app locally:
```
mvn clean install -Dlib -Dcommunity-app
```

After building, use this command to start the `community-app` in production mode:
```
java -jar community-app/target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar
```

# Staging

Staging is auto-updated with main (it takes ~15min to refresh after a merge): https://stage.code.quarkus.io

You can check deployed commit hash on: https://stage.code.quarkus.io/api/config

# Promote to production

It is automated based on the [acceptance tests](https://github.com/quarkusio/code.quarkus.io/tree/main/acceptance-test)
